First of all, we’ll need to find a suitable 3D model. There are lots of free models available on the internet. However, Three.js recommended to use a model with glTF format due to small file size and efficiency. So I’m going to download the one that already in glTF format. But if you already have a model in other formats, three.js is also support FBX and obj file as well. In this tutorial we had used Lamborghini 3D Model.

We’ll use three.js OrbitControl plugin to add a 360 degree viewer that let the users rotate the camera. Get the OrbitControls.js from github and include it to the page.

This project will help you to learn even better in web development in 2021 and beyond. Mastering these technical skills is vital to your career as a software developer. Whether you want to get a full-time job or become a freelance developer. Or whether you want to become a full-stack or front-end developer... You HAVE to master Javascript. You need to build amazing projects with Javascript. Learn to build Projects on Javascript.
    Here's why:
* Your project will be the best!
* The creation of new libraries and frameworks is also making it possible to build backend programs with JavaScript
* JavaScript is an all-purpose programming language—meaning it runs across the entire software stack.
